# Step-by-Step Configuration Guide

### Objective 

The following deliverables demonstrate how to design, simulate, and implement a basic network. This is achieved by using both virtual tools and physical devices to showcase how different network components connect and interact. This includes diagraming a basic network in Packet Tracer by integrating two LANs, as well as setting up essential network services, like a web server and a DNS server, by using physical Cisco devices. 

### Use Cases for the System

This system can be used in a variety of practical ways within IT and systems administration. 
Below are potential uses for this network:
1. Small Business Network Setup: This design can connect multiple LANs in small to medium-sized businesses by using separate networks for departments such as HR, Marketing, or Finance.
2. Internal Company Network for Web Hosting: This system can be used to host internal websites that employees need access to for daily operations. 
3. Testing for Application Development: Developers can use this network to simulate real-world scenarios where applications are hosted on DNS and web servers that need to be tested in a controlled LAN environment. 
4. Network Troubleshooting and Cybersecurity Practice: This network can be used as a safe environment for security testers to simulate attacks, identify vulnerabilities, and test security configurations.

### Step-by-Step Configuration 

1. Collect Cisco physical hardware, bringing a router and switch to the system setup
2. Collect three ethernet cables and two USB C adapters
3. Collect two networked laptops
4. Attach an ethernet cable from the router to the switch, by plugging in the cable to the ethernet ports.
5. Turn on the ethernet switch. Note, it may take 2-3 mins for the Cisco devices to start up
