# Step-by-Step Configuration Guide

### Objective 
The following deliverables demonstrate how to design, simulate, and implement a basic network. This is achieved by using both virtual tools and physical devices to showcase how different network components connect and interact. This includes diagraming a basic network in Packet Tracer by integrating two LANs, as well as setting up essential network services, like a web server and a DNS server, by using physical Cisco devices. 

### Use Cases for the System
This system can be used in a variety of practical ways within IT and systems administration. 
Below are potential uses for this network:
1. Small Business Network Setup: This design can be used to connect multiple LANs in small to medium sized businesses by using separate networks for departments such as HR, Marketing, or Finance.
2. Internal Company Network for Web Hosting: This system can be used to host internal websites that employees need access to for daily operations. 
3. Testing for Application Development: Developers can use this network to simulate real-world scenarios where applications hosted on DNS and web servers need to be tested in a controlled LAN environment. 
4. Network Troubleshooting and Cybersecurity Practice: This network can be used as a safe environement for security testers to simulate attacks to identify vunerabilites and test security configurations.
