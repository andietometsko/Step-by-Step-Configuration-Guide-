# Step-by-Step Configuration Guide

### Objective 
The following deliverables demonstrate how to design, simulate, and implement a basic network. This is achieved by using both virtual tools and physical devices to showcase how different network components connect and interact. This includes diagraming a basic network in Packet Tracer by integrating two LANs, as well as setting up essential network services, like a web server and a DNS server, by using physical Cisco devices.
